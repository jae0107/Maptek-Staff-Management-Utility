# Maptek Staff Management Utility

This is a staff management web application for Maptek which is an adelaide-based company using Google API. It was developed in Google App Script and Google Sheet. Google sheet is used as database. In Google App Script, JavaScript, CSS and HTML can't be separated. They have to be written in a HTML file.

Only staff accounts have an access to the web, and only authorised staff can edit the staff information. This web shows a org chart and reports including staff detail and gender ratio.
